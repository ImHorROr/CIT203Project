                    <p> Video game development is the process of developing a video game. The effort is undertaken by a
                        developer, ranging from
                        a single person to an international team dispersed across the globe. Development of traditional
                        commercial PC and
                        console games is normally funded by a publisher, and can take several years to reach completion.
                        Indie games usually
                        take less time and money and can be produced by individuals and smaller developers.</p>

                        history
                    </h1>
                    <p>The history of game making begins with the development of the first video games, although which
                        video game is the first
                        depends on the definition of video game. The first games created had little entertainment value,
                        and their development
                        focus was separate from user experience—in fact, these games required mainframe computers to
                        play them. OXO, written
                        by Alexander S. Douglas in 1952, was the first computer game to use a digital display. In
                        1958, a game called Tennis
                        for Two, which displayed its output on an oscilloscope, was made by Willy Higinbotham, a
                        physicist working at the
                        Brookhaven National Laboratory. In 1961, a mainframe computer game called Spacewar! was
                        developed by a group of
                        Massachusetts Institute of Technology students led by Steve Russell.[44]
