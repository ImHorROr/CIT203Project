                    Game development
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Game Development is the art of creating games and describes the design, development and release of a
                    game. It may
                    involve concept generation, design, build, test and release. While you create a game, it is
                    important to think about the
                    game mechanics, rewards, player engagement and level design.
                </p>
                <h1>Video game development for web</h1>

                <p>The modern web has quickly become a viable platform not only for creating stunning, high quality
                    games, but also for
                    distributing those games.

                    The range of games that can be created is on par with desktop and native OS counterparts. With
                    modern Web technologies
                    and a recent browser, it's entirely possible to make stunning, top-notch games for the Web. And
                    we're not talking about
                    simple card games or multi-player social games that have in the olden days been done using FlashÂ®.
                    We're talking about
                    kick-ass 3D action shooters, RPGs, and more. Thanks to massive performance improvements in
                    JavaScript just-in-time
                    compiler technology and new APIs, you can build games that run in the browser (or on HTML5-powered
                    devices like those
                    based on Firefox OS) without making compromises.</p>
